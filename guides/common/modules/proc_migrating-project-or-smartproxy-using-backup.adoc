= Migrating {Project} or {SmartProxy} to {EL-abbr}{nbsp}9

You can migrate your existing {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxyServer} from {EL}{nbsp}8 to a freshly installed {EL}{nbsp}9 system.
ifdef::satellite[]
The migration involves creating a backup of the existing {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxyServer}, which you then restore or clone on the new {EL}{nbsp}9 system.

.Procedure
. Perform a full backup of your {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxy}.
This is the source {EL}{nbsp}8 server that you are migrating.
For more information, see {AdministeringDocURL}backing-up-{project-context}-server-and-{smart-proxy-context}_admin#Performing_a_Full_Backup_admin[Performing a full backup of {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer}] in _{AdministeringDocTitle}_.
. Deploy a system with {EL}{nbsp}9.
This is the target server.
ifdef::satellite[]
. Restore the {ProjectServer} backup by following one of these options:
** Restore the backup.
Restore does not significantly alter the target system and requires additional configuration.
For more information, see {AdministeringDocURL}restoring-{project-context}-server-or-{smart-proxy-context}-from-a-backup_admin[Restoring {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} from a backup] in _{AdministeringDocTitle}_.
** Clone the server.
Clone configures hostname for the target server and you can test it before retiring the source server.
For more information, see {AdministeringDocURL}sec-Cloning_to_Target[Cloning to the target server] in _{AdministeringDocTitle}_.
. Restore the {SmartProxyServer} backup.
For more information, see {AdministeringDocURL}restoring-{project-context}-server-or-{smart-proxy-context}-from-a-backup_admin[Restoring {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} from a backup] in _{AdministeringDocTitle}_.
