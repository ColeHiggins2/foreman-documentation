= Foreman {ProjectVersion} Release Notes

[id="foreman-headline-features"]
== Headline Features

// There are no highlights with Foreman {ProjectVersion}.
=== Experimental {EL} 9 support

This is the first release to provide {EL} 9 packages.
{EL} 9 comes with Ruby 3 and it may affect your templates.
Right now there's no guidance on upgrading.
Because of this it's considered experimental.
Foreman 3.11 plans to provide this.
Users are encouraged to test and provide feedback.

=== foreman-debug is now an optional package

The foreman-debug package is no longer installed by default, and it is now required to be installed separately.

[id="foreman-upgrade-warnings"]
== Upgrade Warnings

// If this section would be empty otherwise, uncomment the following line:
There are no upgrade warnings with Foreman {ProjectVersion}.

=== keycloak-httpd-client-install dropped from {EL} 9

Foreman has shipped its own `keycloak-httpd-client-install` package because initially the version shipped in {EL} 7 was too old to support ODIC.
Recently it was noticed that the version in {EL} 8 contains the required features, but still contains a https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-31496[packaging bug].
The version in {EL} 9 contains all the required features, but is older than what Foreman has shipped.
Foreman 3.10 was the first release on {EL} 9 and it was marked as experimental.
Because of that it's been decided to drop it from Foreman's {EL} 9 packaging.
Users who have this package installed should downgrade it using `dnf downgrade keycloak-httpd-client-install`.

For more details, see https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/37334.

[id="foreman-deprecations"]
== Deprecations

//There are no deprecations with Foreman {ProjectVersion}.
=== `foreman-maintain backup snapshot`

`foreman-maintain backup snapshot` is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
Please use other backup types to replace your use of snapshot.
